# Shift-Allocation-System
This project implements a system for managing employee shifts at a UPA (Emergency Care Unit). The system allows for the allocation of employees to different sectors and shifts, including diurnal and nocturnal shifts. It features a rotation system that periodically changes employees' sectors for training purposes. The system generates and saves CSV files with shift schedules for each sector, ensuring proper coverage and rotation.
